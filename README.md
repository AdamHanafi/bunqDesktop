# BunqDesktop
A desktop implementation for Bunq's API. This app does everything within the application so you don't have to worry about sharing your API key with anyone else!

## Development
```bash
yarn 
```
Run these commands in 2 consoles. One generates the react app and the second takes care of running a electron instance.
```bash
yarn webpack:dev
yarn start
```
