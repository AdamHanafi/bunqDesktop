## Development
We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for package management and the following global packages:
```bash
$ yarn global add cross-env webpack gulp
```
Clone this project and install its dependencies.
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:BunqCommunity/BunqDesktop.git && cd BunqDesktop
$ yarn 
```
Run these commands in 2 seperate consoles. One compiles the react app and the second takes care of 
running an electron instance.
```bash
$ yarn webpack:dev
$ yarn start
```
